# RTP Covert Channel: Exploiting Unencrypted Audio Traffic (Active Development)

Welcome to the RTP Cover Channel project, an innovative exploration into the realm of covert channels and information security. This project is currently under active development and focuses on exploiting unencrypted audio traffic transmitted by Asterisk servers with default settings.

The foundation of this project lies in an intricate process that involves the manipulation of audio payloads. We encode the initial byte of the audio payloads with bytes from the message we aim to extract. This process allows us to exfiltrate data from the host or network, thereby creating a covert channel.

## Project Overview

The RTP Cover Channel project aims to demonstrate a practical implementation of a covert channel using Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). Asterisk, an open-source communication software, is employed as the primary platform due to its wide usage and the default unencrypted communication it provides.

The central premise of the project involves using the audio payloads transmitted via RTP, a protocol used extensively in internet telephony. By subtly encoding the first byte of these audio payloads with the bytes from the intended message, we create a mechanism to clandestinely transmit information.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on understanding of covert channels and their potential impact on information security. In doing so, we hope to raise awareness about the importance of properly securing all forms of communication, even those that may seem innocuous at first glance.

This project also aims to serve as a resource for those interested in network security, encryption, and data protection. Whether you're a student, an enthusiast, or a seasoned professional, the RTP Cover Channel provides a unique perspective into the world of covert communication.

## Instructions for Use

**PacketReceiver.py**: Initiate this script on the host machine that is intended to receive the transmitted message. This machine will act as the listener in the communication channel.

**PacketInterceptor.py**: Activate this script on the Asterisk server during an active session. This is where the message intended for exfiltration is injected. Prior to execution, the user must identify Asterisk session clients.

**Transmission**: Following the initial setup, simply wait for the message to transmit across the network. The encoded message will be carried along with the audio payloads.

## Future Directions

This project is currently in active development, with ongoing efforts to refine our encoding methodology and to explore new ways of exploiting unencrypted communication. Future updates will look to enhance the efficiency of our covert channel, add more complexity, and provide even deeper insights into the world of data exfiltration and network security.

Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for your interest in the RTP Cover Channel project.
